# Nora

Nora is a modern Wayland compositor built with hybrid usage in mind.
Nora allows you to powerhouse the heck out of your desktop but still
keep simplicity in mind.

## Motivation

I currently use [sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway) and it is great.
But my main problem is that it is primarily keyboard driven with very
bad trackpad support (gestures etc) which makes it inconvenient on my
laptop in many scenarios. 

Sometimes I just wish to swipe on my trackpad to switch workspaces
instead of finding awkward positions to place my hand on the Super +
[number] keys.

## Status

The project is still in its very early stages and is quite buggy. 

### Wanted features

- Gestures
- Xdg popups
- Session locking
- Complete workspace/window tiling (hybrid).

### Current features

- Xdg toplevels
- Wlr layer shell
- Incomplete workspace/window tiling.
